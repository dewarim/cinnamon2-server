How to install the binary version:

Create a new folder for Cinnamon and its files.
Copy the files from the config folder into this directory.
Add a global Environment-Variable to your system: CINNAMON_HOME_DIR, which contains
the path to this directory.
Edit the config files. They should contain comments as to what kind of data you need 
to change / edit to reflect your own system's configuration. When in doubt or if you
have any questions regarding the installation process, contact us via dewarim@sourceforge.net
or ingo.wiarda@texolution.eu
Note: currently, you do not need to change the configuration files for Dandelion.

Add a database "demo" and a user "cinnamon" with password "cinnamon" to your
PostgreSQL-database. (The current cinnamon.war is configured for Postgresql. If you need
another configuration, please contact us).

Copy cinnamon.war to your servlet container, for example:
/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/cinnamon.war

Restart the servlet container.
Under http://$your_ip_address:8080/cinnamon/cinnamon you should find an XML-list of
configured repositories.

Further steps: install the OSS-Windows client or experiment with the Safran Java client library.
